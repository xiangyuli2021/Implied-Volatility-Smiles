# Implied-Volatility-Smiles

•	Performed exploratory data analysis of implied volatility smile surfaces for call options written on 4 companies’ stocks (Amazon, IBM, Intel, and Tesla) between the year of 2017 and 2020 at a set of fixed Deltas

•	Trained 4 different three-latent-factor Variational Autoencoders (VAE) models using Python (PyTorch) to generate the mean implied volatility curve for each company’s call options
